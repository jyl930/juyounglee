## Concept — "Field"

The home screen is a drawing, not a grid of thumbnails. Every work is plotted
by **year (x)** and **scale (y)** — Material 10⁻³ m → Object → Interior →
Public 10² m → Virtual ∞ (hatched band). A typed query (borrowed from the
HED LAB search bar) filters the drawing live; type anything to search.
Hover shows a crosshair + coordinate readout and a preview; click opens the
project sheet. `List` gives a quiet index with hover previews.

Marker = type: ■ material · ● public · ◆ virtual space · ▭ UX/UI · ○ paper.

## Editing content

Edit `js/data.js`. Each project's `year` (e.g. `2024.6`) and `scale`
(`0`–`5`, one unit per tier) set its position on the field. Image areas are
drawn placeholders for now.
